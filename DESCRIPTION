Title: Chemotherapy regimen detection via temporal alignment algorithms

Description: A chemotherapy regimen detection algorithm is implemented alongside methods to generate patient-level data from an OMOP-CDM compliant database.
    Utilising a temporal-sensitive Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm, we aim to generate a set of aligned drug regimens for each patient's experienced drug profile, thus allowing a simplification and summarisation of otherwise unreadable drug occurrences.
