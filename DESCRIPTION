Title: Chemotherapy regimen detection via temporal alignment algorithms
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Laurence Lawrence-Archer
Maintainer: This package is maintained by Laurence Lawrence-Archer <ldyer2006@gmail.com>
Description: A chemotherapy regimen detection algorithm is implemented alongside methods to generate patient-level data from an OMOP-CDM compliant database.
    Utilising a temporally sensitive Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm, we aim to generate a set of aligned drug regimens for each patient's experienced drug profile, thus allowing a simplification and summarisation of otherwise unreadable drug occurrences.
