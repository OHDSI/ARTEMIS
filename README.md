# oncoRegimens
A chemotherapy regimen detection package, written in R and Python, implementing a temporal Smith-Waterman algorithm, drawing data directly from OMOP CDM-compliant databases.

By utilising a time-sensitive alignment algorithm, we are able to locate optimal alignments of oncological treatment regimens against patient drug real world data, derived from drug occurence tables in the OMOP CDM.
